            Logistics prototype that models shipment flows and supply-chain checkpoints with a domain-oriented
            structure.

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Polaris translates logistics terminology into usable system entities so shipment movement and checkpoints can
            be simulated with clear lifecycle states.

          <h2>What Was Built</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Shipment and checkpoint models aligned to common supply-chain operations.</li>
            <li>Workflow representation for transitions, handoffs, and tracking status.</li>
            <li>Backend logic prepared for expansion into richer analytics and optimization.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            The prototype validated domain mapping decisions and made it easier to discuss logistics workflows in code.
