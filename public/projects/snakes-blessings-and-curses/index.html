          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This project focused on modeling board state, tile effects, and turn rules in a way that keeps core logic
            reusable for different rule sets.
          </p>

          <h2>What Was Built</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Object-oriented architecture for board entities, turn flow, and events.</li>
            <li>Extensible tile effect handlers for snakes, blessings, curses, and custom rules.</li>
            <li>Modular game loop suited for testing and future features.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            The engine delivered clean separation of concerns so new mechanics could be added without rewriting the
            board model.
